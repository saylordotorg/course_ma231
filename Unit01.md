**Unit 1: Preliminary Information** <span id="1"></span> 
*Before we can begin looking at algebraic structures, such as groups,
rings, and fields, we must review the information that provides the
basis for those structures.  All of these structures have sets, and set
theory applies to groups at their core.  Next, we will review the set of
integers, as integers have all the properties that groups possess. 
Indeed, the set of integers, **Z**, with the operation “+” is itself a
group.*  
 *             
 After discussing sets and operations on them, we will review relations
and functions, as the concept of homomorphisms and isomorphisms arise
from special cases of functions from one group, ring, or field to
another.  Finally, we will look at a special class of function known as
the permutation, which plays a major role in group theory.*
